# Blast Dark
## _An aesthetic Sublime Text theme_

Blast Dark is an eye-candy theme especially made with long coding hours in mind. It features a custom color palette which combines both the lukewarm and the corporate feel into one, single theme.

## Installation
Blast Dark can run on any Sublime 3 versions. But, if you don't want any issues, consider using the latest version for Sublime Text.

There are a few ways you can install this plugin:

- ✨By using Package Control, easier and faster.
- ✨By manually downloading the repository and pasting the .sublime-color-theme file in your Themes folder. (Preferences -> Browse Packages -> Themes) If you can't find the folder, then create it manually.
